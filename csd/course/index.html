<p>As noted in class today, the exam is cumulative and covers everything we covered
in the course, with an emphasis on material covered since the midterm.  The exam
will be roughly 50% multiple choice and 50% short answer.</p>

<p>The lecture notes page contains information on which sections we reached in
the course.  I will post a more detailed exam breakdown tomorrow, as I did for
the midterm.</p>

<p>Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed the course.  It was a pleasure being your instructor.</p>

<p>I have added an HTTP option to assignment 3, since some people are having difficulty with
DNS.  Being a simple ASCII protocol, this option should be quite doable.</p>

<p>Also, I have simplified the DNS client considerably:
  * If the server returns multiple records, you need only display the first result returned.
  * You only need to support querying for an A record.
  * If you implement support for all the records previously listed, then you’ll earn up to 30% in bonus marks.</p>

<p>Also, I’ve decided to allow you to work in pairs on assignment 3.  Regardless of which protocol
you choose to work with, you may work alone or work with a partner.  If you work with a
partner, both students will receive the same grade.</p>

<p>If you’re going to partner up, please let me know who you’re working with.  Also, I suggest
sitting down and doing pairing sessions, rather than splitting up the work and working
individually.  You’ll be surprised how productive pairing sessions can be, with two sets
of eyes looking over the problem at hand and quickly catching problems that may arise.</p>

<p>Feel free to email me with questions you might have.  Lab 6 introduces
Amazon EC2 and helps you start your assignment by getting your EC2 instance
set up.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you have a choice of the type of client you’d like
to build.  If you want a reasonably easy assignment, choose to install
the DNS server and implement the DNS client.</p>

<p>If you’d like a bigger challenge (and up to 20% in bonus marks), you
can choose to install an IRC server and implement an IRC client.</p>

<p>If you’d like to work with a protocol not specified in the assignment,
contact me.</p>

<p>Note that, for this assignment, to ease your end-of-term workload, at
least to some extent, we will not be marking you on style or comments.
We hope that you will try to hand in reasonably clean and modular code,
but we will not assign marks to this.  This should save you time, as 
you won’t have to worry about going back and cleaning up / commenting
your code at the end.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>I wrote the midterm this weekend.  It consists of 77 multiple choice questions,
and 2 (very) short answer questions.  Of the multiple choice, 20 are true/false,
and a few are multiple-multiples.</p>

<p>The exam took me 27 minutes to finish (and I was carefully reading each question
as a student taking the exam would).  Even if takes you three times as long,
you should still have about 20 minutes to check over your work at the end.  All
multiple choice questions are equally weighted (1 mark each), so pace yourself
at one question/minute, and move on if you are stuck on a question.</p>

<p>The questions cover every section from 1.1 - 3.4, as well as labs 1 and 3.
If you’ve been coming to class and following the material, I think you’ll find the
exam quite doable.</p>

last-minute questions.  Good luck with your studies, and I’ll see you Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ok folks, I admit defeat.  I have a wedding to attend today, and
can’t stay up any longer working on lab 3.  True to my word, everyone
gets a 2% bonus (despite the fact that I know that 75% of you
aren’t even ready to do lab 3 anyway). :)</p>

<p>Those who are ready to move on to the networking part of the assignment
should check out Beej’s guide.  I will finish up the lab on Sunday.</p>

<p>Also, those having trouble with the 64-bit course VM should try out
the 32-bit version I’ve now created and uploaded:</p>

<pre><code>vagrant box remove cs3357
vagrant box add cs3357 http://dl.cs3357.ca/cs3357-i386.box
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use it as shown in the lab manual, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant init cs3357
vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>Assignment 1 has been updated with a few minor changes to simplify things a
bit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lines are now terminated by <code>\r\n</code> instead of <code>\n</code></li>
  <li>Expressions are now limited to 78 chars instead of 79 chars</li>
  <li>Removed <code>fp-not-supported</code> error code — just return <code>invalid-expr</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Lab 3 is still in development.  I took the weekend to code the assignment
so that I could focus the discussion of the lab and tailor it exactly to
what you’ll need for the assignment.</p>

<p>Don’t underestimate the assignment.  Implementing the expression parsing
took me longer than I expected.  Start early.  Get the parsing implemented
first, and then add networking after, as discussed in class.  I’ll get the
lab out in the next few days, but if you’re ready to move on to the
networking part of the assignment before then, see Beej’s guide (linked in
the assignment description).</p>

<p>Lab 2 is now available.  Again, note that much of its length is due
to code listings and program output.</p>

<p>This concludes some of the drier, initial concepts that we needed to
get out of the way.  The remainder of the labs will focus solely on
networking concepts, and, with the exception of lab 3, should be a bit
shorter.</p>

<p>Assignment 1 is posted and will be due Friday October 17 at 23:59:59.
We’ll say that weekends count as one day, so submitting the assignment by
23:59:59 on Monday October 20 will be 1 day late.  Try not to be late, though,
because your midterm is that week.</p>

<p>Feel free to email me with questions you might have.  The final lab needed
for the assignment should be ready tomorrow.  In the meantime, if you want
to get started, the assignment description contains a link to an excellent
socket programming tutorial.</p>

<p>Don’t panic about the length.  The manual is filled with pictures

<p>Revamping the Automarking system for this course has taken longer than expected.  We will adjust the assignment and lab schedule accordingly.  We’ll discuss it in class tomorrow, but the plan is to push assignment 1 back by a week, releasing it next week.  The first labs will be released later this week to allow you to get started on it.</p>

<p>We’re only doing the first 5 chapters.  It’s 512 pages.  When you remove the end-of-chapter exercises and other extra pages, it works out to about 432 pages, if I recall correctly.  Divided by 12 weeks, that’s only 36 pages/week or about 5 pages/day if you prefer to read daily.  A lot of the pages have diagrams and sidebars and other figures making it really a pretty quick read – and I’m a very slow reader.</p>

<p>It’s up to you whether or not you feel comfortable just attending lectures and not reading.  As I mentioned the other day, I’ll be following the textbook closely, but, of course, due to time constraints, won’t be able to explain things as in depth as the textbook does.  Exams will be written under the assumption that students are reading the textbook.</p>
